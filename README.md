### Advanced Spring Security Project

#### Overview

Welcome to the Advanced Spring Security Project! This project is a comprehensive demonstration of various security-related modules and features implemented using Spring Security in a Java application. It covers OAuth, OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Basic Authentication, authorities, role-based access control (RBAC), granted authorities, encryption, hashing, and other security best practices.

#### Key Features

- **OAuth and OAuth 2.0:** Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for third-party integrations using OAuth and OAuth 2.0 protocols.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Enable token-based authentication and authorization using JWT for stateless communication and secure API endpoints.
- **Basic Authentication:** Implement a simple username/password-based authentication mechanism for user access control.
- **Authorities and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define fine-grained access control based on user roles, authorities, and permissions.
- **Granted Authorities:** Grant specific permissions to users based on their roles, custom authorities, or business requirements.
- **Encryption and Hashing:** Ensure secure data transmission and storage by employing encryption techniques and password hashing.
- **Security Best Practices:** Follow industry-standard security best practices to protect sensitive information, prevent security vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security standards.

#### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development.
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management and build automation.
- Git version control system for managing the project source code.

##### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-spring-security-project.git



2. Import the project into your IDE and configure the project settings.

3. Configure security settings, authentication providers, authorization rules, and encryption/hashing mechanisms in the Spring Security configuration files (`SecurityConfig.java`, `application.properties`, etc.).

4. Build and run the application using Maven or Gradle commands:


5. Access the application endpoints to test the implemented security features.

### Usage

##### OAuth and OAuth 2.0

Integrate with OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub) for secure authentication and authorization with external services.

##### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Generate and validate JWT tokens for user authentication and authorization in stateless web applications and secure API endpoints.

##### Basic Authentication

Implement username/password-based authentication for user access control, suitable for simple authentication requirements.

##### Authorities and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Define roles, permissions, and access control rules based on user roles, authorities, and business requirements.

##### Encryption and Hashing

Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, and hash passwords using secure algorithms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

#### Contributions

Contributions to improve and enhance security features are welcome! Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review. Follow the project's coding standards, testing guidelines, and documentation conventions.
